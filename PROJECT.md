## Airline modelling

I will be modelling major cities in the US, distances are not accurate. 

I will be answering the following questions:

    1. Find most connected airports.

    2. Least connected airports. 

    4. Can you travel to every airports from a vertex (Eurelian) 

    3. Shortest path between 2 airports (shortest path).
